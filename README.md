# Jupita Swift SDK
This SDK is developed for iOS using Swift 5.4, and utilizes `URLSession` in order to create the required API call requests. This library will allow you to make the required `dump` API calls with Jupita. API call is made asynchronously, thus there are event listeners available to handle the API results.


## Overview
Jupita is an API product that provides deep learning powered touchpoint analytics. Within the SDK documentation, `type` refers to which user the utterance is from. `type` 0 = `touchpoint`, and `type` 1 = `input`, although these labels are handled by the SDK.

The required parameters for the APIs include setting `type`, along with assigning an `touchpointID` + `inputID` to be passed - how this is structured or deployed is completely flexible and customizable. Please note when assigning the `touchpointID` that no data will be available for that particular touchpoint until the touchpoint has sent at least 1 utterance via the `dump` API. 


## APIs
There is one API within the Jupita product – `dump`:

- `dump` allows you to dump each communication utterance.


## Quickstart
### Step 1
Right Click on project name in the `Project Navigator` pane and select `Add Files to` option. Select the SDK folder `Jupita.framework` and make sure to keep `Copy items if needed` selected while adding. Then click on project name under the `Targets` and select  `General` tab. Go to `Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content` section, verify the framework is added correctly and make sure `Embed & Sign` option is selected.


### Step 2
Import the Jupita.framework into your class.


### Step 3
Build Jupita. Insert your API key as the token as well as a touchpoint user ID. In the example below '2' represents the touchpoint_id;

```
let token:String = “authentication token”; 
let jupita = Jupita(token, "2")
```

### Step 4
Dump an utterance from a touchpoint by calling the dump API as a message by specifying the message text and the ID of the input, represented in the example below as '3'. 

The parameter `isCall` is required and set to false by default. This tells Jupita if the utterance is from an audio call. When dumping an utterance from an audio call, set the `isCall` parameter to `true` otherwise set to false;

```
jupita.dump(text: "Hi, how are you?", inputID: "3", type: jupita.TOUCHPOINT, isCall: false) { (result) -> Void in
      switch result {
      case .success(let json):
        debugPrint(json)
        break
      case .failure(let error):
        debugPrint(error)
        break
      }
    }
```

Similarly, call the dump API whenever dumping an utterance from an input by specifying the message text and ID of the input;

```
jupita.dump(text: "Hi, good thanks!", inputID: "3", type: jupita.INPUT) { (result) -> Void in
      switch result {
      case .success(let json):
        debugPrint(json)
        break
      case .failure(let error):
        debugPrint(error)
        break
      }
    }
```

## Error handling
The SDK throws 2 errors:
- JSONException which occurs if the user input is not json compatible. This can be incorrect usage of strings when passed on to the Jupita methods.
- IllegalArgumentException which occurs if the `message_type` set in the dump method is not 1 or 0.


## Error codes
Error codes thrown are 401 when the token is incorrect, otherwise Jupita returns error 400 with details.


## Libraries
Use Step 1 and 2 so that the Jupita Swift SDK is available within the scope of the project. Currently the Jupita Swift SDK is dependent on `URLSession`.


## Classes
The available product under the Swift SDK is Jupita. Jupita can be constructed directly using the public constructor however it is highly recommended to use the `Jupita` class to build the product. This will ensure that mistakes are not made while building the Jupita Swift SDK.

```
let token:String = “your-token”; 
let jupita = Jupita(token, "2")
```


## `dump` method definitions
This is needed for building the `URLSession` request. Next the token and touchpointID needs to be set. Jupita can now be used to call `dump` methods asynchronously. The definitions for the `dump` methods are as follows;

```
public func dump(text: String, inputID: String, type: Int, isCall: Bool, completionHandler: @escaping(_ result: Result<Any,Error>) -> Void?)
 
public func dump(text: String, inputID: String, type: Int, completionHandler: @escaping(_ result: Result<Any,Error>) -> Void?)
 
public func dump(text: String, inputID: String, completionHandler: @escaping(_ result: Result<Any,Error>) -> Void?)
 
public func dump(text: String, inputID: String) 
```

If the values of `type` and `isCall` are not provided by default the values are considered `0` and `false`. Thus `text` and the `inputID` are essential when creating a dump request. To avoid illegal argument error use `jupita.TOUCHPOINT` or `jupita.INPUT` for `type`.

`completionHandler` is a callback which needs to be implemented to listen to the results of the API request. It will return the success message as well as the utterance rating as a double.
